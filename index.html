                        This is a game I worked on as part of a school project early in my second year.
                        The game is themed around ocean trash, where the player is tasked with picking it up using a submarine.
                        The most impressive part of it for me is the caustics effect I managed to create in a pretty limited time frame of about a day out of the three weeks total for the project.
                        Despite the very short time frame we managed to make multiple iterations of the project based on play tests.

                        Like the previous portfolio item this game was made for a group project.
                        From a code perspective it was a lot simpler to build, mainly because we wanted it to be as simple as we could so that anyone including
                        young children could figure out how to play within a minute or two without reading. We succeeded in this task as indicated by play tests.
