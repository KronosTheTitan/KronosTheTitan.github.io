            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>My name is Tjalle Borgers, at the moment I am a Creative Media and Game Technologies student. Henceforth refered to as CMGT.
                I use this website as my personal portfolio and for some other things as well.</p>
            <p>Thus far I have mostly worked with C# both in the context of Unity and separately with a custom engine provided by my school.
                I also have some experience with Java, Processing (basically Java but with less feature and focused on visual things) and obviously HTML and CSS because thats how this website was made.
